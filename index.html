    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I have been passionate about cooking for years, and I have been improving my skills daily for over a decade, especially in Asian cuisine. I also integrate sport into my daily life, running, yoga and a little gentle weight training, during the weekend I like to walk or relax by the sea.</p>
    <p>Video games and anime have been a part of my life since childhood. I find great enjoyment in solving problems and achieving mastery in every tasks. I rarely step away from screens, whether it's for work or entertainment.</p>

    <h3>My career</h3>
    <p>My experience includes five years of art history studies after attending art school preparation. I gained experience working independently in retail, archives, and museums before venturing into entrepreneurship, merging digital creativity with artisanal craftsmanship. I created my jewelry brand entirely from scratch, handling everything from visual identity to communication and online store setup.</p>

    <h4>My projects</h4>
    <p>Now that I have progressed in the bootcamp, I can say that I have an appetite for the back end and all its complexity. I am convinced that my versatility, adaptability, and creativity will find their place within a technical team. If I can now combine the enjoyment I get from problem-solving with teamwork in computer science, that's where I'll focus my efforts.</p>
